    <title>Pets Are Crazy</title>

<body>
<p>My cat is a chunky butt and crazy as hell when hungry. She won't leave you alone unless you give her treats and even then
she continues to act like a demon.</p>

<p>My dog is the exact same way, if he hears the closet door open, he will wake from a dead sleep and run
straight for the door and beg for treats....these spoiled pets of ours.
